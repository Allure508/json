      "Content": "There are a couple of game modes in Brawl Stars, each with its rules and objectives:

Gem Grab is a 3 vs 3 player mode in which the objective is to claim and hold onto the Gems.
Showdown can be split between solo and duos.
Bounty is a 3 vs 3 player mode where you collect stars, which is done by eliminating opponents.
Heist is also a 3 vs 3 player mode, but this time you have to protect your safe, and try to break your opponents at the same time.
Brawl Ball is a mode that, simply put, is soccer with guns.
If you are playing Showdown on a map full of grass and hideouts, then a Brawler focused on short-distance combat, like Bull and Shelly, will give you much more of an advantage than a Brawler that fights long distance, such as Brock or Dynamike. This brings me to my second point: some Brawlers are better for specific modes.",

      "Content": "Alright, I get that most of you already know this, but to be fair, Ive had my fair share of playing with team mates who pick terrible Brawlers for the chosen match, which sadly leads to terrible losses or, at best, incredibly hard-won victories.

So this tip is as simple as it gets: choose the right Brawler for the game mode you are playing. For example, if you plan on doing a solo Showdown, choosing a Support Brawler with low damage is a terrible idea. It will create a huge power difference between you and your opponents.",

Each victory grants up to 10 trophies, but the main focus here is getting acquainted with good players, so that you can play together in the late game, which also leads us to my next tip.",

Knowing how to play as each Brawler also helps you understand how to play against them, which is also helpful.",

Having good decision-making and map awareness is ultimately what decides who wins and who loses. Get to know your Brawler, its strengths and weaknesses, and youll get an enormous advantage in real matches.",

So take your time and aim. If you are surrounded or dont have the chance to aim, then its best to wait for the next best opportunity.",

I also use these maps for mission modes I like the least, such as Brawl Ball. Plus, its a good way to show some love to the map creators.",
