Use the spraycan to mark your route. Further on in the game, when youre racing against the clock, its easy to forget where all the markers are. Use spray paint to draw your route so its easy to follow, when youre rushing to escape.",

Go back to missions when youre better equipped â€“ especially if you missed optional objectives the first time around.
Use vehicles in your mission routes. Check around the map to see what kind of vehicles are available to use. You want to try and avoid wasting time by simply running, if possible, and have cars to take you from one objective to another. Test to see which ones are the fastest or most reliable.",

Do the same (as above) for boats. The same rules that apply to vehicles also apply to boats on these maps. Try them out and line them up so you can zip around maps with ease.",

Clearing your debris creates a clearer path and ultimately, a quicker mission completion time.
Or use the debris... as blocks to jump on, as bridges, ramps or to fill gaps. Be creative with it!
Planks are really useful! Use them for ramps, to fill gaps, attach objects to cars, or to stop things from falling out when youre speeding away.",

Its safe to say that there are a few missions in the Teardown campaign that are a challenge! While most of the walkthrough takes you through how to complete both the required and optional objectives for each mission, some need a little more preparation and practice to fully complete the objectives.",
