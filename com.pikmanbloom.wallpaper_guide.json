Steps are counted in the background even when the app is not open using minimal battery usage. Android users may need to install Google Fit if they dont already have it, and combine it with a smartwatch if they dont want to be with their mobile on all the time. You do not need to move from your location on the map to receive the steps. You can walk on site or on a treadmill. Little by little you will unlock different types of seedlings as you level up. You can only have a maximum of 30 seedlings in reserve, but this number can be increased in the store.",
