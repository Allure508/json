So one of the main things i want to cover is having fun, whatever you do, if there are bases where people spawn at. DO NOT CAMP THEM, it can get really annoying and can lead to you being kicked and/or ridiculed. Secondly, use vehicles from the era. “I dOn’t HAvE a VehicLE fRom thEN” Isnt a gaht daym excuse. Experimental Vehicles most people are fine with, but before you pull out that K-Wagen get confirmation with the owner. YES, Also show them it. For the love of god, if someone is having lots of fun, don’t ruin it by pulling out a counter to it. The point of battles is to have fun, while being realistic. Maintain Realism, Hosts if you have poor moderation, its no moderation. So someone with a MiG-17 in a ww1 server will not be okay with Most ALL people, Speaking of 17 its the amount of seconds people will still be in your server. Dont Intentionally lag the game, nobody likes it. Nor Trolling. Even if you are somehow lagging the game, and people tell you to remove it. Remove it. Also if you don’t like something, Don’t fuss. Thats why there is a button to exit.",
