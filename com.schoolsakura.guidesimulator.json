      "title": "Getting Started",
      "Content": "With five playable characters, both male and female available, this game is perfect for anyone. The mobile game is played in a little fictional Sakura town. A mixed world, this amazing game combines both of the situations in the real high school everyday life in Japan and the situations which are shown in Japanese animations that everyone knows sometimes include very fantastic elements. And the best part is the ability to control and change Four players in the same scene. Each action you make towards the other NPCs will affect your gameplay, leading you to different situations.",

      "Content": "What to cause some mayhem? Go to the Yakuza office (there are two men wearing black clothes walking outside it). Kill all the members, and go up to the two-door and kill the other members. Then to the doors on your left and kill the leader. You will find in the building 4guns, 1 sword, and 7000 yen. Also remember that if you don’t kill the members, or even die, they will keep following and attacking.",

      "Content": "If the police are after you, lead them to a corner, where one is in front of the other, or stand behind one of the officers. If one shoots another, the other will attack back, and you will no longer be their objective. If one kills the other, additional police will go after them and you will have successfully escaped death.",

      "title": "Customizing your character",
      "Content": "One of the amazing things about this game is the ability to customize your characters (the boy and the girl), with some costumes giving you cool powers like the Alice in wonderland dress that give you the ability to shrink/grow. You also have the ability to change the outfit’s colors, your eyes, and even the color of your hair. Some costumes increase your damage, and some just turn you into a toddler or a baby. Yes, you heard right, you have the option to play as a baby. Another interesting concept to this game is that death itself doesn’t exist. If you kill someone, they have fainted but will not die. This means that if you kill someone, they will wake up the next day, and they will hate you and track you down. In this amazing game you decide the story, you decide how popular you will be. If you want to drive around, you have that ability to drive until you destroy your car and spawn it again. If you feel like changing you clothes, simply go to your house and quickly change before continuing on your way.",
