Stay back and snipe the enemies with your bow or go up close and personal with a boom with the explosive stick. My favorite combination is the shield and crossbow. Protect yourself from any potential bombs.
At the end of the level is the most interesting thing I have seen in VR. All the trolls have grenade launchers and dance around the fire trying to murder you. It’s super fun. I wish Rec room would implement a better movement system for high action paced moments.",

I highly recommend starting off with a machine gun as you can position yourself in the back and give your team back up from the bots. My favorite feature of this gun is the sight that you can use to grab the other end with your other hand and aim down the sight.",

I had an extremely intense moment in VR where the flying creatures surrounded me and I had a shield and dodged all of the fireballs while jumping and ducking. I bashed one of the flying creatures with my shield but then it got up and killed me.",

Reaching for the ball can be confusing, my first time I ended up bending all the way down to grab it. All you need to do is aim your controller towards the ball and it will highlight in green and should be able to pick it up.
The game can become really immersive leading to you running around dodging everything.",

Disc Golf is one of my least favorite of the list of games in Rec Room. It is really hard to control the frisbee when throwing it. The slightest mistake could send your disc flying in the wrong direction.",
